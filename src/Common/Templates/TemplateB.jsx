                    <p>Verzenio can cause <b>fetal harm</b> when administered to a pregnant woman, based on findings
                        from animal studies and the mechanism of action. In animal reproduction studies, administration
                        of abemaciclib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis caused teratogenicity and
                        decreased fetal weight at maternal exposures that were similar to the human clinical exposure
                        based on area under the curve (AUC) at the maximum recommended human dose. Advise pregnant women
                        of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective
                        contraception during treatment with Verzenio and for 3 weeks after the last dose. Based on
                        findings in animals, Verzenio may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential. There are
                        no data on the presence of Verzenio in human milk or its effects on the breastfed child or on
                        milk production. Advise lactating women not to breastfeed during Verzenio treatment and for at
                        least 3 weeks after the last dose because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in
                        breastfed infants.&nbsp;</p>

                        concomitant use of ketoconazole. Ketoconazole is predicted to increase the AUC of abemaciclib by
                        up to 16-fold. In patients with recommended starting doses of 200 mg twice daily or 150 mg twice
                        daily, reduce the Verzenio dose to 100 mg twice daily with concomitant use of strong CYP3A

                        concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors. If a patient taking Verzenio discontinues a strong
                        CYP3A inhibitor, increase the Verzenio dose (after 3 to 5 half-lives of the inhibitor) to the
                        dose that was used before starting the inhibitor. With concomitant use of moderate CYP3A
                        inhibitors, monitor for adverse reactions and consider reducing the Verzenio dose in 50 mg
